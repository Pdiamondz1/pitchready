# Project Foundation

A reusable, self-improving **project foundation** you clone to start new work with four
capabilities built in from day one:

- **2nd-brain knowledge** — a disciplined `raw/ → wiki/ → outputs/` knowledge base
- **Auto-researching** — sync skills that pull in sessions, ecosystem data, and curated content
- **Self-learning** — repeated work is distilled into reusable wiki pages and skill candidates
- **Self-healing** — an `improve-system` loop that proposes fixes behind human approval gates

It ships with a **file-first AIOS web console** (`aios/`) that surfaces the knowledge
base and the approval queues — no database required. It is structured so a Supabase +
vector-RAG upgrade (a live agent) is purely additive later.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `raw/` | Original, immutable ingested assets. Never edited by hand or AI. |
| `wiki/` | AI-written table of contents over `raw/`. Never hand-edited. |
| `outputs/` | Generated reports + the self-improvement approval queues. |
| `.claude/skills/` | The skills that grow and maintain the knowledge base. |
| `aios/` | The file-first AIOS web console (added in Phase 3). |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/` | The design spec. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | The load-bearing operating rules (read this first). |

## How knowledge flows

1. You drop something in (a file, a session, a link).
2. A skill copies the original, unaltered, into the right `raw/` folder.
3. The skill writes/updates a `wiki/` page that indexes and references it.
4. `improve-system` periodically proposes improvements, routed through approval gates.

## Quickstart

This repo is the template. To use it for a new project, clone it and start adding
knowledge. In Claude Code, run the **`add-new-resource`** skill and follow the interview
to capture your first asset. The operating rules in `CLAUDE.md` load automatically every
session.

## Status

Built in phases (see the spec):

- **Phase 0 — knowledge foundation + `add-new-resource`** ✅ in place
- Phase 1 — ingest/sync skills + `data-ingestion` orchestrator
- Phase 2 — `improve-system` + `human-improve-system` (self-healing)
- Phase 3 — the `aios/` web console (file-first)
- Phase 4 (deferred) — Supabase + vector RAG + a live agent
